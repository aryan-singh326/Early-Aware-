Early Aware

AI-Powered Preliminary Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool
Live App

📌 Overview

Early Aware is an AI-driven web app that provides a preliminary breast cancer risk assessment using simple, non-invasive health metrics.

Developed as part of a research project under the mentorship of Dr. Surajit Dey (Roseman University), Early Aware uses neural networks trained on medical datasets to classify tumors (benign vs malignant) with peak predictive accuracy of 99.12%.

⚠️ Note: This is a research project and should not be used as a replacement for professional medical advice or diagnostic tools.
